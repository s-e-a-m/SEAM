Sustained Electro-acoustic Music is a project inspired by Alvise Vidolin and Nicola Bernardini's article on live electro-acoustic music sustainability. They point at multiple faces of the sustainability problem such as: technological, notational or general conception issues. In the article they focus only on live electro-acoustic music but the concept is applicable to any kind of documented music that uses electro-acoustic environments and this will be the purpose of the present text.

The ambition of this project is to grow the interpretation and the electro-acoustical musical practice with the consciousness of the electronics and informatics problems that had made difficult to approach to this music and that prevented the growth of an interpretative thinking. It is possible, with a community structure, to determine, build and stratify interpretation of musical core, the repertoire, concealing the technological issues. They are instruments, not the music itself.

When we refer to a virtuoso musician, often, we point at a violinist or a piano player; someone who intensely practice on his instruments. This is the point: Does the violinist builds its own violin every time he approaches a new composition? Does the pianist do it? The electro-acoustic musician does it.

The electro-acoustic music culture was born in a daily changing context. The sustainability of what the electro-acoustic musicians and composers were doing during the years wasn't an interesting and useful point during the realisation of the compositions. Today the situation remaines similar to decades ago. Sustainability is an intricate and complex concept and *music sustainability* sounds like an *abstract problem* applied to an *abstract thing* only for a small number of people; like an *abstract community* not related to the mass. Again, we know that mass-media, mass-culture, mass-things, are no place for the *sustained people*.

If actual music is afflicted or not by the contemporary and electro-acoustic music issue, it is an ordinary question, but the evidence that musical thinking changed thanks to the electro-acoustic thinking is an innegable fact. Music was changed inexorably after the introduction of electronics and informatics in music composition, playing and production.

Here are the points. What will it happen when all the people who manipulate those electronic and production problems during a concert will disappear? What it will become the electro-acoustic music repertoire if it not the solely music played in the concert hall? Why we concentrate too many resources and time on technical problems and not on musical interpretations and playing practices?

Looking at the Post-Graduate Doctoral offers to an electro-acoustic musician all over the world, there are many *interactive-all-you-can-think-about* positions but nothing with the words *electro-acoustic repertoire*. There are a lot of *Machines (that are) Learning* something, somewhere. All over the world, the music industry conceived the purpose of doing music. With or without problems. During that well studied *interaction learning* and, during this art of entertainment, where the industry is god, and god is a DJ; meanwhile there is also a repertoire of music that we must consider the core of the actual musical thinking that will disappear in a few years. Not the written papers, neither the recordings of that repertoire. We have *clouds* for that, and *Machine Learning* something of that, maybe. But it will disappear the practice, the interpretation, and musical thinking itself and there will be no place for that. Because if there are clouds, they are grey and full of rain.

An example. We have three interpretations of Beethoven's Complete Symphonies, by the famous conductor Herbert von Karajan. Each of those boxsets is a separate thing, a collection of objects. Not music itself. We have three sets of reproduction of the same musical things through the same mind. It is a huge resource of thinking, not a huge resource of music itself. Every man who has listened to Beethoven in a concert hall knows perfectly that his music can't fit in a box that can stay in a hand. But if the boxset is not Beethoven's music itself, it is sure an object of thinking. There is a point, sure, this is not the purpose it was built, but it doesn't matter. The point is that we have stratified musical thinking and listening attitude on Beethoven's music through interpretations of his music. We have not rewritten his music each time and we have not built his instruments each time. Is it a technological fact? A musical one? Both of them.

We have to study Vidolin's gestures to understand Nono, to have a clear sight on our music through an era. [contemporaneo] Vidolin is for Nono what Karajan was for Beethoven. We need his work to know what was happening, what we have to do, what it is necessary and what doesn't matter. And that is we have to do, just one time, forever; refine it, maintain it, and again realise it forever.

Luigi Nono's repertoire is not on a triple boxset of no one. It is on paper, in the best of the case. We have some recordings, yes we have them. What can we study and interpret, if half of the ensemble in a score was *Live Electronics Instruments* dated the '80s and it was not really described and not really *sustained* through the years? Who has memories of those instruments?

What can we do about a lot of music made by composers who have framed their music in events without sustain at all their electronic instruments through decades?

There are concepts we must consider dogmatic to re-build and sustain an
electro-acoustic repertoire: Open, D.R.Y., Community. SEAM is an open, dry,
community.

The SEAM manifesto is:
  1. Be Open
  2. Don't Repeat Yourself
  3. Think and act in the community.
