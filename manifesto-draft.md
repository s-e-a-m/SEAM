Sustained Electroacoustic Music is a project inspired by Alvise Vidolin and
Nicola Bernardini's article on electroacoustic music sustainability. They point
at multiple faces of the problem: technological issue, notational issue or simple
conception issue. They focus only on live electroacoustic music but, this is the
purpose of the present text, it is applicable to any kind of documented music
that uses electroacoustic material.

The purpose of this project is to grow the interpretation and the electro-acoustical
musical practice with the consciousness of the electronics and informatics problems
that had made difficult the approach to this music and prevented the grown of an
interpretation thinking. It is possible, with a community structure, to think and
build to stratify interpretation of musical core, the repertoire, concealing the
technological issues. They are instruments, not the music itself.

When we refer to a virtuoso musician often we point to a violinist or a piano player.
Someone who intensely practice on his instruments. This is the point: Does the
violinist build his own violin every time he approaches a new composition?
Does the pianist? The electroacoustic does.

The electroacoustic music culture was born in a daily changing contest. The
sustainability of what they were doing during the years wasn't a point for decades.
Actually, today neither. Not to the community. Sustainability is a complicated
concept at all. Music sustainability is something like an abstract problem applied
to an abstract thing only for a small number of people, like an abstract community
not related to the mass. Again, we know that, Mass-media, mass-culture, mass-things
are not place for the *sustained* people.

So we are speaking about a small problem in music culture. A small problem not for
mankind. But it is a problem. If the actual occidental music is or not afflicted
by the contemporary and electroacoustic music issues is a good question, but that
the music thinking was changed by electroacoustic thinking is a fact. Generally,
we can consider that music was changed inexorably after the introduction of
electronics and informatics in composition, playing and production.

Here are the points. What will happen when all the people who manipulates those
problems will disappear? What is the electroacoustic repertoire if it is not the
music played in the concert hall? Why we concentrate too many resources on
technics problems and not to musical interpretations and playing practice?

We can simply look at the Doctoral offers all over the world. There are so many
interactive-all-you-can-think-about. The music industry conceived the purpose of
doing music. With or without problems. During that interaction, during this art
of entertainment, where the industry is god, and god is a DJ, during this time
there is also a repertoire of music we must consider the core of the actual musical
thinking that will disappear in some years. Not the paper, neither the recordings.
Will disappear the practice, the interpretation, the thinking itself.

What will happen to the Luigi Nono's music after Alvise Vidolin? We have to study
Vidolin, to understand Nono, to have a see sight on our music through an era.

An example. We have three interpretations of Beethoven's Complete Symphonies, by
Karajan. Each of those boxsets is a thing, a collection of objects. Not music
itself. We have three sets of reproduction of the same musical things through the
same mind. Is a huge resources of thinking. Not a huge resource of music itself.
Every man who has listened to Beethoven in a concert hall knows perfectly that his
music can't fit in a box that can stay in a hand. But if the boxset is not
Beethoven's music itself, it sure is an object of thinking. There is a point, sure,
this is not the purpose it was built, but it doesn't matter.  The point is that
we have stratified musical thinking and listening attitude on Beethoven's music
through interpretations of his music. We have not rewritten his music each time.
We have not built his instruments each time. It is a technological fact? A musical
one too.

Luigi Nono's repertoire is not on a triple boxset of no one. It is on paper, in
the best of the case. We have some recordings, yes we have. What we can study and
interpret if half of the ensemble is Live Electronics Instruments dated the '80s
and it was not really described, not really sustained through the years?

What do we think about a lot of composers who have framed their music in events
without sustain at all their electronic instruments through the year?

There are concepts we must consider dogmatic to re-build and sustain an
electroacoustic repertoire: Open, D.R.Y., Community. SEAM is an open, dry,
community.

The SEAM manifesto is:
  1. Be Open
  2. Don't Repeat Yourself
  3. Think and act in the community.
