Sustained Electro-acoustic Music is a project inspired by Alvise Vidolin and Nicola Bernardini's article on electro-acoustic music sustainability. They point at multiple faces of the sustainability problem: technological issues, notational issues or general conception issues. They focus only on live electro-acoustic music but, this is the purpose of the present text, the concept is applicable to any kind of documented music that uses electro-acoustic environments.

The purpose of this project is to grow the interpretation and the electro-acoustical musical practice with the consciousness of the electronics and informatics problems that had made difficult the approach to this music and prevented the grown of an interpretation thinking. It is possible, with a community structure, to think and build to stratify interpretation of musical core, the repertoire, concealing the technological issues. They are instruments, not the music itself.

When we refer to a virtuoso musician, often, we point to a violinist or a piano player. Someone who intensely practice on his instruments. This is the point: Does the violinist builds his own violin every time he approaches a new composition? Does the pianist? The electro-acoustic does.

The electro-acoustic music culture was born in a daily changing contest. The sustainability of what they were doing during the years wasn't a point for decades. Actually, today neither. Sustainability is a complicated concept at all. Music sustainability sounds like an *abstract problem* applied to an *abstract thing* only for a small number of people, like an *abstract community* not related to the mass. Again, we know that mass-media, mass-culture, mass-things, are no place for the *sustained people*.

If the actual music is or not afflicted by contemporary and electro-acoustic music issue, it is an ordinary question. But, again, the music thinking was changed by electro-acoustic thinking is a fact. Music was changed inexorably after the introduction of electronics and informatics in music composition, playing and production.

Here are the points. What will happen when all the people who manipulate those problems will disappear? What is the electro-acoustic repertoire if it is not the music played in the concert hall? Why we concentrate too many resources on technical problems and not to musical interpretations and playing practice?

Looking at the Post-Graduate Doctoral offers to an electro-acoustic musician all over the world, there are many *interactive-all-you-can-think-about* positions but nothing with the words *electro-acoustic repertoire*. There are a lot of *Machines (that are) Learning* something, somewhere. All over the world, the music industry conceived the purpose of doing music. With or without problems. During that well studied *interaction learning* and, during this art of entertainment, where the industry is god, and god is a DJ, during this time, there is also a repertoire of music we must consider the core of the actual musical thinking that will disappear in some years. Not the paper, neither the recordings. We have *clouds* for that, and *Machine Learning* something of that, maybe. It will disappear the practice, the interpretation, the thinking itself and there's no place for that. If there are clouds, they are grey and full of rain.

An example. We have three interpretations of Beethoven's Complete Symphonies, by Karajan. Each of those boxsets is a thing, a collection of objects. Not music itself. We have three sets of reproduction of the same musical things through the same mind.  It is a huge resource of thinking. Not a huge resource of music itself. Every man who has listened to Beethoven in a concert hall knows perfectly that his music can't fit in a box that can stay in a hand. But if the boxset is not Beethoven's music itself, it sure is an object of thinking. There is a point, sure, this is not the purpose it was built, but it doesn't matter. The point is that we have stratified musical thinking and listening attitude on Beethoven's music
through interpretations of his music. We have not rewritten his music each time. We have not built his instruments each time. It is a technological fact? A musical one, too.

We have to study Vidolin to understand Nono, to have a see sight on our music through an era. [contemporaneo] Vidolin is for Nono what Karajan was for Beethoven. We need his work to know what was happens, what we have to do, what is necessary and what doesn't matter. And then we must do it, just one time, forever, and refine it, maintain it, forever.

Luigi Nono's repertoire is not on a triple boxset of no one. It is on paper, in the best of the case. We have some recordings, yes we have. What we can study and interpret if half of the ensemble in a score was *Live Electronics Instruments* dated the '80s and it was not really described, not really sustained through the years? Who has memories of those instruments?

What do we can do about a lot of music made by composers who have framed their music in events without sustain at all their electronic instruments through the year?

There are concepts we must consider dogmatic to re-build and sustain an
electro-acoustic repertoire: Open, D.R.Y., Community. SEAM is an open, dry,
community.

The SEAM manifesto is:
  1. Be Open
  2. Don't Repeat Yourself
  3. Think and act in the community.
