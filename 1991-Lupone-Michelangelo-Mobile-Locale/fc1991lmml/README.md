# 1991 - Michelangelo Lupone - Mobile Locale - Faust Code

For the composition *Mobile Locale* in 1991, Lupone had realized electronics on
his *FLY30* workstation. Both live electronics and tape electronics were programmed
on a *FLY* system.

The porting was approached from the block diagram and instruction on the score
not by the *FLY* code itself, but the fine-tuning and the impulse response of
each block will be done with the composer and the *FLY* machine to compare code
and sound qualities.
